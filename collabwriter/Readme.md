# CollabWriter

Real-time collaboration is a (not mature) feature introduced in
Substance Beta 4.

This example creates two editors within one browser communicating
via WebWorker (Hub) and IFrames (Clients) using the
basic CollabHub implementation.

A real server-side integration is shown in other examples apps such
as [substance/notes](https://github.com/substance/notes).
